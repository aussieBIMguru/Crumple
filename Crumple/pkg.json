{"license":"","file_hash":null,"name":"Crumple","version":"2024.4.3","description":"Nodes built by Gavin Crump (Aussie/BIM Guru) for Dynamo 2.12 and Revit 2022. Not tested in other builds, results may vary. The contents of the package is quite variable, but most nodes are developed to support everyday model management and delivery automation needs for architects using Revit.\r\n\r\nMost nodes in the package run in CPython3 which comes with Dynamo, but the nodes under the IronPython section of the package will require IronPython2.7 (v2.5) to be installed. These nodes were not updated due to incompatibilities with CPython3 (interfaces, com objects, datetime kinds etc.).\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","group":"","keywords":["bim","model","manager","aussie","gavin","audit","family","families","guru","revit"],"dependencies":[],"host_dependencies":["Revit","IronPython2","CPython3"],"contents":"© About.AussieBIMGuru - Opens the Aussie BIM Guru YouTube channel., © About.BIMGuruEducation - Takes you to my course and content platform, courses.bimguru.education., © About.Crumple - About the package., © Windows.FilterBackups - Given a filepath or list of filepaths, separate out any backup file paths., © Areas.Create - Given a view and a list of points, will create new areas at them.

The node will temporarily hide elements in the viewport view to get the true centrepoint., © Viewports.Relatives - For a viewport, returns the related view and sheet., © Views.Ancestry - Returns the parent of a view, and the parent of that view, and the.... etc. Will also return if it had any parents, as well as the depth of the view's family tree., © Views.ApplyTemplateByName - Given a list of views and a view template name, attempts to find and apply that template. Unlike Dynamo nodes, this process also works with 3D view templates as it runs within Python entirely., © Views.CreateDependents - Given a list of names and a view, will generate a set of dependent views upon that view with those names., © Views.CreateElevationBodies - Given a list of points and an elevation view type, will create elevation bodies (without markers) at those points., © Views.CreateElevationViews - Given elevation bodies and a list or list of lists of indices between 0 and 3, will activate those markers on that body., © Views.CreatePlans - Given an even list of levels and names and a view type, this node will create new plan views for those levels and attempt to rename them if a name is available. You can automate the application of view templates by assigning them to the view types in Revit as well. If you feed in a ceiling plan type, it will make a ceiling plan due to how the ViewPlan API works., © Views.Dependents - For a view, returns any dependent views it has as well as whether it has any., 🐍 Views.FromSun - Given a list of sun directions, view names and a 3D view type this node will create views from the sun. If a view already exists by name, it will be returned but not updated., © Views.GetCropBox - Returns the curves of a view's cropbox (even if not visible/active). Also returns whether the cropbox is currently visible and active as booleans., © ViewSheetSets.Create - Given a list of views and/or sheets, will create a sheet set for them with the given name. If the set exists by name, it will be recreated., © ViewSheetSets.Views - Return all views and sheets in the view sheet set(s)., © Views.Level - Returns the associated level of a view (if it has one), as well as a boolean mask to remove views without levels after., © Views.Open - Opens a Revit view (can also be a sheet)., © Views.OverrideCrop - Overrides the crop boundary of provided views to a given thickness. Note that this only works for elevation views due to Revit limitations., © Views.Parent - For a view, return it's next related parent view if any. Will only retrieve one level above (even if it's parent has a parent etc.)., © Views.Phase - Given a view or list of views, returns the phases applied to those views as elements., © Views.Primary - For a dependent view, return it's primary view, as well as if it has one., © Views.SectionBox - Returns the section box of any view as a bounding box in Dynamo. Does not support section boxes with rotations applied to them (will return the original section box before rotation), and will actually return a bounding box even if a view doesn't have one applied. Use with care!, © Views.SetCropBox - Given a view and one polycurve, sets the boundary of that views crop to the curves of that polycurve. Will not accept multiple polycurves or a list of curves., © Views.SetPhase - Given a list of views and a single phase, will set the views phases if possible., 🐍 Views.SetSunSettings - Given a list of views, apply a datetime and shadow intensity setting to their sun settings (still). You will need to update the shadows on/off setting manually or via a view template., © Views.Sheet - Returns the first sheet a view is found on, if any., © Walls.CurtainGridCount - Returns the horizontal and vertical grid counts for curtain walls. Note that sometimes the parameter does not match the model for spacing based rules!, © Warnings.Message - Given a warning element in Revit db format, will return the message associated with that warning in a generic string format., © Warnings.RelatedElements - Returns the element(s) associated with the provided warning., © Web.LMGTFY - ChatGPT for dummies., © Web.UrlOpen - Given a URL, will attempt to open in the default web browser used by Windows., © Windows.ClipboardReceive - Attempts to retrieve the current data on the clipboard., © Windows.ClipboardSend - Attempts to send data to the clipboard., © Windows.Desktop - This node returns the active username, as well as a path to the user's Desktop., © Windows.DirectoryContents - Be aware there is an OOTB node that can do this, but I wanted to add this to the package so others can see how to use a Python method as a starter block in other scripts., © Windows.DirectoryOpen - Attempts to open a directory path., 🐍 Windows.EmailSend - Given Outlook is open, this node will attempt to send an email to a list of recipients with a subject and body., © Windows.FileSize - For given file objects, returns their size in bytes, kilobytes and megabytes., © Windows.MyDocuments - This node returns the active username, as well as a path to the user's My Documents., © Windows.Printers - Returns all print driver names installed on the machine., © Windows.TempFiles - This node returns the active username, as well as a path to the user's Temp files., © Windows.UserFolder - This node return's the active username, as well as a path to their user folder., © Windows.UserNames - This node returns the users Windows and Revit user names., © Windows.UserPaths - This node returns the active username, as well as common user paths including:\r\n- Desktop\r\n- My Documents\r\n- Temp\r\n- Dynamo Revit (for active build)\r\n- Dynamo Revit logs (\" \"), © Worksets.Create - Attempts to create worksets given a provided name. Will return whether it was successful in each case, as well as the new workset's Id where it was (and a null where it wasn't)., © Worksets.IsolateInView - Given a list of views and a list of worksets or workset names, attempts to isolate them all in those views., © Worksets.Rename - Will attempt to rename a workset to a newly provided name. If the workset cannot be renamed, a null value will be returned as well as a success report.","engine_version":"2.12.1.11123","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"www.youtube.com/aussiebimguru","repository_url":"https://github.com/aussieBIMguru/Crumple","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["Package.customization, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"]}
